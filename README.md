2. You have to git clone <https://gitlab.com/YuukiPS/GC-Resources> to your local PC first

## How to use

0. git clone this repository to your local disk
1. git clone https://gitlab.com/YuukiPS/GC-Resources to the project folder (Or download only the latest version of the resource to save your disk space)
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/YuukiPS/GC-Resources.git
    ```
2. Find `Common/conf.py` and change the `dataPath` and `prodPath` variables.
3. `pip3 install opencc pypinyin`
4. cd to `{ProjectRoot}` and run `python3 app.py`
5. The program will run and produce some output to console.
6. The generated files required by Rime (Squirrel) will be produced at `{ProjectRoot}/Build` folder. Copy all the three files there to your Rime config folder.
7. Re-deploy your input method and enjoy
